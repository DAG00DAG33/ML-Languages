# ML-Languages
Here I have different projects done with each main ML library
- tensorflow
- Keras
- Pytorch

Also a notebook called cheatSheet where I have code snippets to copy and paste and assemble projects quickly. These are just in my style, surely the whole process can be done in other ways, and probably much better.

With each library I want to do the following projects:
- Image classifier (Fingers - Dedos)
- Autoencoder (Faces) (In the Keras version it has sliders to modify the face)
- GAN (with the database of faces)
- Bw2Color
